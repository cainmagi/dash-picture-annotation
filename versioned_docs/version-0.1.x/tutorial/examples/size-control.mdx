Check the following link to review the demo of controlling the annotation size.

<p>
  <DarkButton to={demoURL("size_control.py")} icon={mdiLanguagePython}>
    {"size_control.py"}
  </DarkButton>
</p>

This demo provides the following features:

1. A basic [`DashPictureAnnotation`](../../apis/DashPictureAnnotation.mdx) allowing
   1. Creating, modify, or removing annotation boxes by dragging and dropping.
   2. Modify the annotation label by an input box.
2. Every time the annotation data is changed, the changed results will be reflected
   by the text below the annotator window.
3. Configure a requirement of the minimal values of the annotation width and height.
   Creating or resizing an annotation with a width or height smaller than the given
   value will let the annotation removed.

## Define the layout

Compared to the [minimal demo](./minimal.mdx), the main change is to add a property
`size_minimal` in the definition of the component:

```python
dpa.DashPictureAnnotation(
    id="annotator",
    style={"height": "80vh"},
    data=None,
    image="/assets/test_image.svg",
    options=None,
    clearable_dropdown=True,
    # highlight-next-line
    size_minimal=20,
)
```

This property is motivated to control the minimal size of annotations. Sometimes, users
may click the annotator by mistake, which may create an annotation box with `width=0`
and `height=0`. In this case, the created annotation is meaningless and the not
selectable. Compared to letting users to sanitize the data by themselves, it is better
to add such a property that specify a limitation of the minimal width and height. By
adding this property, any annotation with a size smaller than the specified value will
be removed.

:::tip

The property `size_minimal` can be configured by a dictionary like this:

```python
dpa.DashPictureAnnotation(
    ...
    # highlight-next-line
    size_minimal={"width": 20, "height": 20},
)
```

which allows users to specify different limitations with respect to the width and
height, respectively.
